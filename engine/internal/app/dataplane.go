// Wiring the XDP data plane into the daemon: starting it, hot-reloading its
// static policy, and reporting what it is doing to /metrics, /healthz and
// /api/v1/status.
//
// A THIRD THING USED TO LIVE HERE and is worth recording, because its absence is
// now load-bearing: a startup REFUSAL for a ladder containing `action:
// dataplane` that the mitigator had no backend for. Such a rung resolved to the
// empty method and was announced as an alert-only stage — the ban recorded, the
// notification sent, the metrics moved, and the traffic forwarded. The refusal
// was written as a function of mitigate.SupportsDataplane() precisely so that
// the change adding the backend would retire it without anyone having to
// remember it existed. That change has landed, SupportsDataplane() is true, and
// the guard has been deleted rather than left as dead code that reads like an
// active safety net. What replaced it is stronger than a startup check: the rung
// now installs, and an install that fails degrades to the configured fallback
// with FellBackFrom set, so the failure is visible per ban instead of per boot.
//
// The tripwire that keeps the silent alert-only bug from coming back is
// mitigate.TestSupportsDataplaneMatchesStageView, which fails if stageView stops
// returning a real method for the action.
